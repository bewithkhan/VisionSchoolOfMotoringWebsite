## Overview

Vision School of Motoring is a driving school based in [Mention Location if applicable, e.g., Glasgow]. This website serves as an online presence for the school, providing information about driving lessons, pricing, areas covered, and contact details. It also facilitates online bookings and payments for lessons.

* **Responsive Design:** The website is fully responsive and accessible on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
* **SEO Optimized (Optional - Add if applicable):** Basic search engine optimization implemented to improve online visibility.

## Development Skills Showcased

This project demonstrates proficiency in the following areas:

* **Frontend Development:**
    * HTML5: Semantic structure and content markup.
    * CSS3: Styling, layout (potentially using frameworks like Bootstrap/Tailwind CSS or custom CSS), and responsive design implementation.
    * JavaScript (ES6+): Interactive elements, form validation, potentially dynamic content loading, and integration with third-party services.
    * [Add any specific JS frameworks/libraries used, e.g., React, Vue, jQuery]
* **Backend Development (Optional - Add if applicable):**

## Integrations

### Payment Links

* **Method:** Payments are handled using [Specify Payment Gateway, e.g., Stripe, PayPal, SumUp].
* **Implementation:** [Explain how it's implemented. Examples:]
    * **Example 1 (Simple Links):** Direct payment links generated via the [Payment Gateway] dashboard are embedded into the website for specific lesson packages. Clicking these links redirects the user to the secure payment gateway page to complete the transaction.
    * **Example 2 (API Integration):** The website integrates with the [Payment Gateway] API. When a user selects a package or booking, the backend communicates with the gateway to create a payment session/intent, and the user completes the payment via a checkout form (potentially embedded or redirected). Webhooks might be used to confirm successful payments and update booking statuses.
    * **Example 3 (Booking System Integration):** The payment gateway is integrated directly into the online booking system. Payment is required to confirm a booked slot.

* **Contact Form:** [Mention service used, e.g., Formspree, Netlify Forms, or custom backend endpoint] handles submissions from the contact form, potentially sending email notifications.
* **Analytics:** [Mention analytics service, e.g., Google Analytics] is integrated to track website traffic and user behavior.
* **Mapping:** [Mention mapping service, e.g., Google Maps API] might be used to display service areas or the school's location.
